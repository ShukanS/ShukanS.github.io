                                The player&#39;s hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they touch the
                                bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble this is called
                                carrying the ball and the player will lose the ball to the other team.

                                If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player
                                must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot. You
                                may not switch your pivot foot.

                                that is a travelling violation.

                                The ball and player must remain in bounds. If the ball or a player in possession of
                                the ball touches the floor or wall out of bounds, the ball is returned to the
                                opposing team. The last player who touched the ball will be called for an out of
                                bounds violation.

                                No player can touch the basketball while it is travelling downward towards the basket
                                or if it is on the rim. This is called goaltending. (touching the ball on the rim is
                                legal in some games). Goaltending will result in the basket being counted for the
